# react-snake
This is simple snake game build with react.js, I didn't use any 3rd party library beside React.js.

## Installation
The project contains an HTML, a CSS, and some additional audio files. You can download the zip file and open index.html in your browser (I tested Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Edge).

Or you can try the demo in [here](https://nsun1989.github.io/react-snake/).
